# convolutional-Neural-Network-using-tensorflow-
This a basic coding for tensorflow using mnist dataset.
#SOME PROS AND CONS OF THE THIS CODE;
This scripted is coded without the use of any helper functions which is great for newbies..but with great power comes greater difficulty of running the code on even 2GB gpu..so yeah ..
This script has some issues like:
>its slow..very slow
>not that accurate ..but could be made, by using more hidden layers,normalisation,dropouts,gradient batch decent...and the list continues.
>FORK IT AND TRY TO REMOVE ABOVE ISSUES IF YOU CAN 
@CIFAR10 DATASET WITH TENSORFLOW COMING UP SOON WITH MORE ADVANCED TECHNIQUES.
